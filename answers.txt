Q 1 

To make a socket you use the following code
TcpSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Where the first parameter is the address family and the second parameter is the socket type.

So if you want a TCP connection you would pass socket.SOCK_STREAM in the second parameter since 
socket.SOCK_STREAM is telling the socket to have a TCP connection type.

Q 2 

the client socket does not have to bind to a fixed ip address and port, while 
a server socket's needs to bind to a port/ip so its location is known.
Also the client socket does not need to constantly listen to it, while a 
server must always listen to that socket.

Q 3 

This is done by setting the socket.SO_REUSEADDR flag.
By giving a socket s s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
This tells the kernel to reuse that same socket during its TIME_WAIT state
without having to wait for its default wait time to finish.

Q 4

We get information about the clients ip address, port number, address family (ipv4, ipv6)
and socket type (udp,tcp). All this information can be retrieved from printing conn and addr.

Q 5

recv() returns the empty byte object b", which is an indicator that the connection
loop is terminated.
